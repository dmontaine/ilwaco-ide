'#  Minimal, dependency-free JSON parser/serializer for the Agent MCP pipe.   #
'#  Shared by astoria.exe (AgentPipe) and the astoria-mcp sidecar, so it must #
'#  not depend on the MFF framework or any DLL. Strings are UTF-8 throughout  #
'#  (the pipe and MCP both speak UTF-8); callers convert to/from WString at   #
'#  their own boundary.                                                        #
'#                                                                             #
'#  DOM shape follows cJSON: each value owns a first-Child pointer and a      #
'#  NextSib pointer (object members carry Name). No dynamic-array UDT fields  #
'#  needed. Delete of the root frees the whole tree via the destructor.       #
